Repo to track and document the process of creating a data visualization dashboard of Middlebury College's Greenhouse Gas Inventory. This is built upon the work of many collaborators who
I will make sure to credit. The working group on this iteration consists of Mike Roy, Jack Byrne, Dean Ouellette, & Julia Deen. 

The dataset is dynamic and updated [insert frequency] [insert methods]  , the data used in this prototype comes from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16tsgi58C68tAbQIpL6XeYAyirA8M2ave/edit?gid=111470763#gid=111470763
[Title: For CN Work- GHG FY22 w FY25 projections]. The FY 24/25 projections are not included in this iteration. 


Initial Conception of Project Description & Process (by Mike Roy)
 -The goal of the energy dashboard project is to provide easy access to data regarding Middleburyâ€™s historical energy consumption, and to create a way of 
doing this that is sustainable over time. 
-There are two main types of data that we will begin with. The first is the raw electrical data that is being automatically archived. The other is the multi-year GHG inventory that you  have maintained.
-For both, we will document where the data comes from, the process of transforming, and storing the data, and all of the people and technologies currently involved in this. We will clarify roles and responsibilities for all parts of both the current and proposed processes. 
By looking at previous work in this area, as well as examples of other energy dashboards, we will develop a set of ways to visualize and explore the two data sets.
